"Using branches is a powerful and safe way for a team of software engineers to collaborate because it allows each developer to work on new fixes or features independently without affecting the main codebase. Through isolating the work in branches, developers are able to make changes, experiment, and commit updates without having the risk of braking codes that other people may rely on. Working in branches brings benefits for more organized work and reduces the confusion when multiple people are working on the same project at the same time. When it comes to how branches help prevent problems such as overwriting a teamate's work, losing progress from conflicting changes, and bringing bugs into code. When a feature is complete and tested, it can be safely merged into the main branch. Git's history makes it simple to track changes or revert to a previous branch in the case that an issue arises."
